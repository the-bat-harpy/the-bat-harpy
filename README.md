## Hi!
This is my first personal coding project, with the sole purpose of storing and easily acessing the resources I have found that are helpful in my degree (a mixture of a comp sci degree with management).
It's quite simple, done with HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. I do admit I had no clue what I was doing here, so the organization is somewhat strange, but it worked for what it was supposed to, so that's great in my point of view.
